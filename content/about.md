Hi, I'm S Azam Sajjad, a passionate DevOps Engineer with over 10 years of experience in Linux system administration, automation, and cloud technologies. My career has taken me from managing enterprise-level infrastructure to leading cloud-native transformations in complex environments. I specialize in AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and automation tools like Ansible and Jenkins. Currently, I work at Eurus Technologies, where I help companies achieve cloud infrastructure compliance and implement scalable DevOps solutions.

On this blog, I document my journey, share best practices, and troubleshoot issues I encounter in the fast-paced DevOps world. I believe in continuous learning, and I'm always excited to share what I learn with others in the community. Whether you're just getting started with DevOps or are looking to deepen your understanding, you'll find plenty of tips, tutorials, and real-world solutions here.
